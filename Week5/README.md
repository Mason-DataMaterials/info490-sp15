#Week 5 Overview#
## Data Visualization ##

The lessons this week will focus on using an iPython notebook to create and use fast numerical arrays and to make data visualizations. This week we switch our focus from general programming tasks, to data visualization. In particular, you will learn how to make numerical arrays by using the Numpy library, to make general plots, and how to create and interpret scatter plots and histograms by using the Matplotlib  and Seaborn libraries.


### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to use the Numpy library to perform fast array and matrix operations
- Understand how to use Matplotlib within an iPython notebook to create a new plot
- Understand how to use the Seaborn library to improve the appearance of a Python plot.
- Understand how to make scatter and histogram plots in Python
- Understand how to use scatter plots and histograms to understand a data set
