# INFO 490: Introduction to Data Science #

INFO 490: Introduction to Data Science uses an project-based approach to indoctrinate students into the tools and technologies necessary for working with large data.

## Course Goals ##
Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand the basic concepts of data science. Students will learn how to work at a Unix prompt and how to use the Python programming language to process, visualize, persist, model, and mine large data sets.

## Prerequisites ##

There are no pre-requisites for this course, except for an interest in learning the basic skills necessary for being a data scientist and access to a computer to participate in the course lectures, and to complete the required course assignments. NOTE: To complete the assignments in this course, a student will need to have root access to a UNIX system, for example a Linux or mac based computer. Since installing all of the software we use in this class can be difficult, we strongly encourage students to use a virtual machine in which we have pre-installed all course software. Thus, before starting the online course, students will be expected to have successfully installed the course-specific virtual machine (this requires installing the freely available Docker application). Instructions are provided in the Mandatory Orientation Module of this Moodle course site.

## Texts ##

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will utilize internet accessible websites and documentation as supplemental material to the lesson content.
