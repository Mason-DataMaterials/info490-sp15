#Week 7 Overview#
## Introduction to Statistics Analysis ##

In this week, you will be introduced to statistical analysis, which is very important with large data sets since you may need to either make a decision based on summary information or make a quick decision without being able to completely scan a data file. Furthermore, you also might wish to model some data component, in order to make future predictions or to better understand some physical process. All of these cases require an understanding of basic statistical analysis, which we will cover during week seven of this course. This week, you will learn about summary statistics, density functions, distributions functions, basic Bayesian analysis, and introductory statistical analysis including lear modeling and regression.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to compute summary statistics on a data set.
- Understand the different density functions.
- Understand the differences between basic distributions functions and where and how these functions can be applied.
- Understand how to perform basic Bayesian statistical analysis.
- Understand how to perform basic linear modeling.
